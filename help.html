It is recommended that you keep this page up while you play, so that you can refer to it in order to get command syntax correct.

The Pandemic board consists of three sections -- a map of the world, a section containing player names and their hands, and some extra information and buttons on the right hand side.   All moves can be made by clicking on the game page.
